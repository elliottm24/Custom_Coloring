# Custom_Coloring

Some issues in the code I thought would be good to clarify so you know I'm aware of them:
1. The hitboxes for all the pieces of the face are done in squares, that means that there are some areas
that may not be drawn on that will still trigger the selection of an object because a lot of the pieces are circles.
2. I am unsure why it's occuring, no matter what I did I couldn't fix it, but when you click on a new piece the color
for the piece of the face you just changed is reset to it's original color. I'm guessing this has to do with the way
the colors were initially initialized.
3. The GUI currently only works in portrait mode. Turning it will result in a very ugly drawing and you won't be
able to access the seekbars. PLEASE KEEP IN PORTRAIT MODE!

Thank you!
